The Pulse Module Extraction AI Agent is designed to automatically identify, extract, and organize relevant modules or components from structured and unstructured data. This project uses artificial intelligence techniques to analyze input data and extract meaningful modules, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

The AI agent processes the input, understands the context, and extracts important information in a structured format that can be further used for analysis, reporting, or automation.
